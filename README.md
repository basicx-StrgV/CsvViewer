# TerminalCsvViewer

## What is this project

This project was a small school assignment as part of my vocational training.  
Therefore this is not a finished product and the application is not optimized. This repository is intended as a reference and archive.

## What does it do

The goal of this assignment was to create a small program in Java that can read .CSV files and display the content.

This program will ask the user to input the .CSV file and then validate if the given file can be read and is a .CSV file.  
After that the file will be read line by line. While reading, the first line will be counted as the header and every other line as data.

After the file is read, the date will be rendered as a table to the console.
